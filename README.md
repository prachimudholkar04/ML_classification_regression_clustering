# Brainstroke Classification, Regression, and Clustering

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on analyzing brainstroke data using classification, regression, and clustering techniques. The aim is to provide insights into stroke prediction, analyze contributing factors, and uncover patterns in the data.

## Features
- **Classification:** Predict whether an individual is likely to experience a stroke based on key features.
- **Regression:** Model the relationship between input variables and stroke severity or recovery metrics.
- **Clustering:** Group individuals into clusters to identify patterns and segment high-risk groups.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing relevant features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and other medical and lifestyle factors. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed for accuracy.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/brainstroke-analysis.git
   cd brainstroke-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notebooks
- `ML_Assignment.ipynb`: Main notebook for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset in the specified format.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook step-by-step:
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Train models for classification, regression, and clustering.
   - Evaluate performance metrics.
3. Visualize results using plots provided in the notebook.

## Requirements
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Results
- **Classification Accuracy:** XX%
- **Regression RMSE:** XX
- **Clustering Insights:** Key findings about group characteristics.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset for higher generalizability.
- Integrate deep learning methods for improved predictions.
- Add interactive visualizations.
